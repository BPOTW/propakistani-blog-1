    <p>The Federal Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment (FOSPAH) has ruled that excessive CCTV monitoring of employees amounts to workplace harassment.</p>
    <p>In a case filed by a female staff member of a private educational institute in Rawalpindi, Ombudsperson Fauzia Viquar imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000 on the institution’s chief executive officer for misusing surveillance to intimidate her.</p>
    <p>The complainant alleged that she was subjected to persistent monitoring and harassment, including instances where CCTV images were sent to her directly.</p>
    <p>After examining the evidence, the ombudsperson concluded that the surveillance was unnecessary, discriminatory, and created a hostile work environment.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the institution was directed to implement workplace reforms, including the formation of an inquiry committee and the public display of a code of conduct in English and Urdu.</p>
    <p>FOSPAH stressed that harassment extends beyond inappropriate advances, covering any act that undermines dignity, privacy, or instills fear among employees.</p>
    <p>“This ruling reinforces that surveillance cannot be weaponized to target or control staff. Respect for privacy and dignity is a core workplace right,” the ombudsperson’s office stated.</p>
